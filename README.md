# Metacritic Project
* The most controversial game of 2020, The Last of Us: Part II sparked disparity amongst critics and users around the world and this is evident on Metacritic, the review aggregator website. The game scored 94 out of 100 overall from critics â€“ one of the most highly acclaimed games ever. However, the overall user score was 5.6 out of 10 denoting a low-average review score.
* Two deep neural networks were created to detect the level of bias in reviews on the site Metacritic for the top 25 and worst 25 video games of all time. 
* The first model was trained using an Amazon dataset reviewing fine foods on the Kaggle website (See: AmazonModel.ipynb).
* The second model was trained using data scraped from Metacritic using 22 games (See: Web_Scraping.ipynb & MetacriticModel.ipynb).
* An in-depth analysis was carried out using both models on the reviews of three games on Metacritic. One of them being The Last of Us Part II (See: TLOU2_BIAS.ipynb).
* The Amazon model led to a higher degree of accuracy than the Metacritic model (74% vs 68%).
