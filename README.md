# Metacritic Project
* Two deep neural networks were created to detect the level of bias in reviews on the site Metacritic for the top 25 and worst 25 video games of all time. 
* The first model was trained using an Amazon dataset reviewing fine foods on the Kaggle website (See: AmazonModel.ipynb).
* The second model was trained using data scraped from Metacritic using 22 games (See: Web_Scraping.ipynb & MetacriticModel.ipynb).
* The model trained on Amazon data led to a higher degree of accuracy than the Metacritic model.
